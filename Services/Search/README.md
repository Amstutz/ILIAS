## Media Objects and Content Snippets

Content Snippets and Media Objects are only found when using Lucene 
search, and not direct search. They are displayed as sub-objects of
Media Pools.

When searching by (Custom) Metadata in the Advanced Search, Content
Snippets and Media Objects are never found, regardless of whether
Lucene or Advanced Search is used (but they can be found when
in the 'Content' field of the Advanced Search).
